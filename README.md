# GEN811_Final_Project: Bacterial Genome Assembly

### By: Emily Persson
## Background
The data used in this project are forward and reverse sequences from two different unidentified bacterial organisms. In total, two forward and two reverse sequences were used. The project aims to identify the two organisms by assembling their genomes from these forward and reverse sequences. 
## Methods
The sequences from the two unidentified bacterial organisms were provided by Kaleb Ducharme, a TA at the University of New Hampshire. Using the university's supercomputer RON and multiple tools, the genomes were assembled.
